  <div class="tab-pane container active" id="friend">Friendship means familiar and liking of each other's mind.

People who are friends talk to each other and spend time together. They also help each other when they are in trouble or are hurt. Friends are people that can be looked up to and trusted. Usually friends have similar interests. A friend is one who admires a person's skill and helps or encourages them to make the right choices and do not get into any trouble at all.

The strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very strong, they are called best friends. This can usually be achieved by possessing the elements of friendship, by being kind, generous, loyal, honest and by having fun. With these qualities you can truly enjoy the bliss of friendship.

There are expectations, demands and complaints in friendship too. If friends don't match with your expectations, it does not mean you will break the friendship. It is all about understanding, realizing and helping whenever possible.

Friendship is both good and necessary. Man cannot live all alone. He is a social being. He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows. Generally, it is only people of similar age, character and background, mentality, etc., who can understand him and his problems. Friends are needed for support and for sharing.</div>
  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="love">Love is a mix of feelings and actions that shows a deep liking for someone or something. Romantic love can lead to things such as dating, marriage but a person can also feel for friends, such as platonic love, or family. There are also chemical reactions within the brain that can be triggered by the different types of love.</div>
  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="affection">If you are affectionate, you show your love or fondness for another person in the way that you behave towards them.</div>
  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="marry">A marriage is the relationship between two people who are married.
In a good marriage, both partners work hard to solve any problems that arise.</div>
  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="enemy">An enemy or a foe is an individual or a group that is verified as forcefully adverse or threatening. The concept of an enemy has been observed to be "basic for both individuals and communities". The term "enemy" serves the social function of designating a particular entity as a threat, thereby invoking an intense emotional response to that entity. The state of being or having an enemy is enmity, foehood or foeship.</div>
  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="sister">A sister is a woman or girl who shares one or more parents with another. Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships. A full sister is a first degree relative.</div>
